# Learn React in Baby Steps
Learn to develop single page web apps (SPAs) in baby steps using [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) and [Babel](http://babeljs.io/). 
The web world is moving forward at breadth taking speed. First, JavaScriptâ€™s next version [ES 2015](http://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) is almost here, but the browsers will take some time to start supporting it therefore the need for [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) during the interim period. For others who prefer strong typing on top of ES 2015 another option in [TypeScript](https://github.com/ziaukhan/learn-typescript). However, the most interesting battle that is shaping up is in the Single Page App (SPA) development space. In the coming years it will be hard fought battle between [Angular 2](https://github.com/ziaukhan/learn-angular2) and React.
In these tutorials we will learn React using ES 2015/Babel.
